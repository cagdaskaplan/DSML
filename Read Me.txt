Hi :)

a)lenet_weight saving for each batch.py helps  saving weights for each batch of a LENET from MNIST dataset.You should increase 
epoch number to have a stabilization of weight values

b)Plotting 3 weights from a csv.py helps plotting 3 weights alteration.
You should combine h5 files with listing using glob(clue) function also for creating a csv file.

c) After that you can compare with Prophet functions.
